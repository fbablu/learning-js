# Chapter 01 


First we go to this (link)[https://supersimple.dev/js-basics/] which is a test playground. We inspected element and did some console logging to get a feel of what JS does, which is simply providing the website some instructions to complete a task. 


In this case, we just wrote out `alert('hello')` as an example and an alert on the browser came up. We did some simple math to show onto the console.


Next we modified the document with `document.body.innerHTML = 'hello';`, removed all the content on the screen and replaced it with hello.
