// setup in https://supersimple.dev/projects/amazon/, go to home page and add a toaster 18.99 to the cart,  so theres:

/*
1 basketball 
1 t-shirt
1 toaster (4.99 shipping for the toaster)
*/


// calculate the cost of the products (before shipping and taxes)


(20.95 * 100 + 7.99 * 100 + 18.99 * 100) / 100 // = 47.93
